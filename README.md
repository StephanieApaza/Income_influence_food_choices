# Food Prices, Income, and Dietary Habits Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between household income, food affordability, and dietary habits.
By analyzing four datasets ‚Äî Income-Expenditure, Food Prices, and Dietary Habits Survey ‚Äî the analysis provides insights into how income levels affect food access, 
the consumption of healthy versus unhealthy foods, and regional variation in food affordability.
The project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to highlight key socioeconomic and nutritional trends.

## üéØQuestions
- Income & Food Affordability: How does household income relate to the affordability of different food categories?
- Healthy vs. Unhealthy Purchases: Do higher-income households buy healthier foods?
- Nutritional Value vs. Cost: Are healthier foods more expensive than processed options?
- Policy Focus: What factors should policymakers target for intervention?

## üí°Key findings
**Income & Disposable Income:** Higher monthly income generally correlates with higher disposable income. However, household size significantly affects disposable income, reducing financial flexibility for larger families.

**Healthy Food Consumption - Survey:** Fresh fruits and vegetables are consumed frequently (daily or weekly), especially vegetables, which are often part of every meal.
Seafood consumption remains very low, with "never" being the most frequent response.

**Unhealthy Food Consumption - Survey:** High intake of salty and sweet foods, often weekly or even daily, across all income groups. 
Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages are consumed regularly, though daily soft drink intake is not the majority. Dairy-based sugary drinks are consumed more consistently, often once a day.

**Regional Food Prices:** Fruits, vegetables, and grains have regular price levels.
Meat & Protein Foods and Other Foods are the most expensive groups, concentrating the largest proportion of household food spending.

## ‚úÖConclusion
The analysis highlights a dual challenge:
1. While many households maintain frequent consumption of healthy items like fruits and vegetables, unhealthy foods and beverages remain heavily consumed, particularly salty, sweet, and fried foods.
2. Income disparities and family size strongly impact disposable income, influencing food affordability and consumption patterns.
3. Regional differences in food prices further limit equal access to nutritious diets, especially for medium-income households with larger family sizes.
